# Abstract

To those who invest in CKB long term, wallet security is always the number 1 priority. Currently locking their CKB to the DAO with a hardware wallet seems best because it offers high security (but not Ledger). As we know CKB blockchain can support Passkeys SECP256r1 and [joyID has already leveraged that](https://discord.com/channels/1065112455170228314/1065116735797215332/1191939677440180335).

I want to offer an affordable and highly secure option for Nervos longterm investors to interact with the Nervos DAO without having to buy a hardware wallet. This project aims to enable Nervos DAO interaction via JoyID with Passkeys native level security.
